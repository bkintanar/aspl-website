# automated Subject Proposed-list System

The project is in it's infant stage.

Basically I have stated the gist of the project in our chat, but here's a deeper overview of the project.

##Definition of terms

###Prerequisite Subject
a subject a student should pass first before being able to take a subject.

###Corequisite Subject
a subject a student should take with the subject he intended to enroll.

###Proposed-list
a list of subject that a student can take up for next semester. this would be based on a veriety of things.
 (1) needs to check the current standing of the student and what semester he is currently on. since the proposed list will be limited on the allotted number of units a student can take depending on the year level and the semester the student is in. this data can be found by checking the curriculum the student is under.
 (2) the subjects that should be listed here should have met all prerequisite subjects.
